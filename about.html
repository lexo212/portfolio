        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm Alexander Amare, a passionate third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
            at the American College of Technology, situated around 4 kilo.
            <br>
            From a young age, I've been fascinated by the inner workings of technology and computers, which ultimately
            led me to embark on this thrilling journey in the realm of computer science.
            <br>
            Throughout my academic tenure, I've delved into various programming languages, explored intricate
            algorithms, and engaged in practical applications that have fueled my enthusiasm for this dynamic field.
            <br>
            The amalgamation of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience has sharpened my problem-solving skills
            and instilled in me a deep curiosity to continually explore and innovate.
            <br>
            As I navigate through my educational path, I'm eager to leverage my skills and passion to contribute
            meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
